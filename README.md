# Adyen Components for iOS

Adyen Components for iOS allows you to accept in-app payments by providing you with the building blocks you need to create a checkout experience.

## Installation

Adyen Components for iOS are available through either [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) or [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage).

### CocoaPods

1. Add `pod 'Adyen'` to your `Podfile`.
2. Run `pod install`.

### Carthage

1. Add `github "adyen/adyen-ios"` to your `Cartfile`.
2. Run `carthage update`.
3. Link the framework with your target as described in [Carthage Readme](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#adding-frameworks-to-an-application).

## Drop-in

The [Drop-in](https://adyen.github.io/adyen-ios/Docs/Classes/DropInComponent.html) handles the presentation of available payment methods and the subsequent entry of a customer's payment details. It is initialized with the response of [`/paymentMethods`][apiExplorer.paymentMethods], and provides everything you need to make an API call to [`/payments`][apiExplorer.payments] and [`/payments/details`][apiExplorer.paymentsDetails].

### Usage

#### Presenting the Drop-in

The Drop-in requires the response of the `/paymentMethods` endpoint to be initialized. To pass the response to Drop-in, decode the response to the `PaymentMethods` structure:

```swift
let paymentMethods = try JSONDecoder().decode(PaymentMethods.self, from: response)
```

Some payment methods need additional configuration. For example, to enable the card form, the Drop-in needs a public key to use for encryption. These payment method specific configuration parameters can be set in an instance of `DropInComponent.PaymentmethodsConfiguration`:

```swift
let configuration = DropInComponent.PaymentMethodsConfiguration()
configuration.card.publicKey = "..." // Your public key, retrieved from the Customer Area.
```

After serializing the payment methods and creating the configuration, the Drop-in is ready to be initialized. Assign a `delegate` and use the `viewController` property to present the Drop-in on the screen:

```swift
let dropInComponent = DropInComponent(paymentMethods: paymentMethods,
paymentMethodsConfiguration: configuration)
dropInComponent.delegate = self
present(dropInComponent.viewController, animated: true)
```

#### Implementing DropInComponentDelegate

To handle the results of the Drop-in, the following methods of `DropInComponentDelegate` should be implemented:

---

```swift
func didSubmit(_ data: PaymentComponentData, from component: DropInComponent)
```

This method is invoked when the customer has selected a payment method and entered its payment details. The payment details can be read from `data.paymentMethod` and can be submitted as-is to `/payments`.

---

```swift
func didProvide(_ data: ActionComponentData, from component: DropInComponent)
```

This method is invoked when additional details are provided by the Drop-in after the first call to `/payments`. This happens, for example, during the 3D Secure 2 authentication flow or any redirect flow. The additional details can be retrieved from `data.details` and can be submitted to `/payments/details`.

---

```swift
func didFail(with error: Error, from component: DropInComponent)
```

This method is invoked when an error occurred during the use of the Drop-in. Dismiss the Drop-in's view controller and display an error message.

---

#### Handling an action

When `/payments` or `/payments/details` responds with a non-final result and an `action`, you can use the Drop-in to handle the action:

```swift
let action = try JSONDecoder().decode(Action.self, from: actionData)
dropInComponent.handle(action)
```

In case the customer is redirected to an external URL, make sure to let the Drop-in know when the user returns to your app. Do this by implementing the following in your `UIApplicationDelegate`:

```swift
func application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey: Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
    Adyen.applicationDidOpen(url)

    return true
}
```

## Components

In order to have more flexibility over the checkout flow, you can use our Components to present each payment method individually. Implementation details of our Components can be found in our [Components API Reference][reference].
